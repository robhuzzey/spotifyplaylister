Background
-----------

I'm not a fan of the way the Spotify App doesn't allow me to organise my songs by Genre... also, I wanted a way to tailor the suggestions with some tweaking or parameters. I'm hoping this will achieve this goal?

Prerequisites
-------------

- [Node.js 6.10.0+](http://nodejs.org)

Getting Started
---------------

```
# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Then simply start
npm start
```

Developing
----------

```bash
npm run start
```

This will run a webpack server with a watch task & rebuild on any changes

Building
--------
```bash
npm run build
````

Will create a bundle in `docs/` suitable for deployment on github pages.
